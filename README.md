# BoomBikes-Assignment
## Built a linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.


## Problem Statement:  

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes a Mobility Services firm has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

Essentially the company wants :
- To understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19, by creating a linear model.
- To identify the variables affecting their revenues i.e. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. How well those variables describe the bike demands

They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.


## Business Goal:  

You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

- For the variable Season we can see that Fall has the highest median, which means the demand was high during this season. It is the lowest in 1: Spring.
- The count of users is more in the year 2019 than 2018.
- For the variable Holiday, the median is higher on the days when it is not a holiday.
- The count of users is almost same throught the week as observed for the variable Weekday.
- From WorkingDay we can see that the median is almost similar. So the count of users was not affected whether it was working day or not.
- From the variable WeatherSit, we can see that there are no users for heavy rain. And the count is higher when the day is clear.

- Increase in temprature also increases the demand of bikes, so it should keep track of temprature.
- Demand is higher in winter season, so it should be prepared to meet the demands
- Holiday season seems to be least interesting for biking.
